Notes:
--	Both the HOST, the Medusa VM, and the cleint VMs must have the same time and the time must be sync'ed with AWS (w/in 5 mins).  This is especially important for the
	Windows VM.  If the timezone on the host and the VM must be the same

Requirements:
DHCP Scope for 192.168.222.0/24 (reservations for 7,8,10,17,18,20; MAC AAAAAAAAAAxx where XX is the 07, 08, etc.)
Hyper-V Networks named: ExternalAccess (external), RPDAccess (internal), Privnet (internal or private)
MedusaC has two networks (ExternalAccess is eth0, Privnet is eth1)

System Requirements:
* Any current Intel i7 or Xeon processor supporting hardware virtulization
* 16 GB of RAM or greater (8 GB is accetable)
* 1 TB SSD (1 TB HDD [platter based] is accetable, but I/O performance my decrease with VM usage)
